## ABOUT US
The methodical complexity of blocks and blocks of code can often intimidate beginner programmers and non-programmers alike, thereby preventing them from delving into the art of programming further. The aim of this project is to aid the visualisation of complex algorithms that would usually scare learners off. We hope that by presenting our favourite algorithms in an aesthetically pleasing way, we can plant that seed of curiosity and interest towards programming in learners. Our intentions are to show people how long lines of code can give a beautiful end product- to demonstrate that you can turn the seemingly mundane into the magnificent. Welcome !!
